summary: "Introduction to the GP Connect Access Record HTML capability"
---

{% include important.html content="This version of the Access Record HTML capability is undergoing pilot testing with GP system providers, and maybe subject to change following a period of clinical feedback.  If change occurs, a new version of the specification will be released. Please consult the GP Connect programme before starting any work with this capability." %}

For direct patient care purposes only, the Primary Care record contains a wealth of useful information which can improve patient safety and efficiency if it is made interoperable (subject to IG and Clinical Safety requirements) across health care settings.

{% include important.html content="Please refer to page 28 of [HSCIC Guide to Confidentiality 2013 reference document](https://digital.nhs.uk/media/1235/HSCIC-Guide-to-Confidentiality-2013-reference-document/pdf/confidentiality-guide-2013-references.pdf#page=28){:target='_blank'} for details of what constitutes direct patient care." %}

The information "sections" in scope for care record access are:

1. Summary
2. Encounters
3. Clinical Items
4. *Administrative Items*<sup>*</sup>
5. Referrals
6. Immunisations
7. Problems and Issues
8. Medications
9. Observations
10. *Investigations*<sup>*</sup>
11. Allergies and Adverse Reactions
12. Patient Demographics (minimal)
13. Patient's GP Practice and Organisation (minimal)


{% include important.html content="The 'Clinical Items' section exists as it is not currently possible to reliably distinguish procedures, diagnoses, symptoms and other clinically coded items into their own sections due to the way they are stored in the primary care record Principal systems. " %}

{% include important.html content="Initially some sections of the patient care record (marked above with a <sup>*</sup> may not initially be available from all primary care record Principal systems.  The 'Investigations' Section will be considered for future release, so investigation results will be included in the Observation Section" %}

## HTML View ##

{% include roadmap.html content="Work is currently underway to refine the GP Connect HTML views to ensure alignment (where appropriate) with SCR, GP2GP and GPES requirements." %}

### Purpose ###

In an unstructured and pre-rendered format (HTML), this capability will provide health professionals with access to a patient's primary care record by requesting sections or headings. Where appropriate, a date range can be defined to filter the retrieval of larger sections. These views can be incorporated directly into Electronic Patient Record systems.

Significant effort has already been made to unify the HTML section views from all four principal suppliers but it is expected that this will be an iterative process during development, UAT and FoT.

The content displayed in the HTML views has then been used as a common base line of available data to guide the structured and coded 'Access Record' approach.

### Use cases ###

- Extended access GP practices can view all of the patients primary care views even when the record is held on a different GP system.
- Other care settings (e.g. 111, Physio, Community, Emergency, Acute/Secondary, Social) can view the patients GP record (those held by the patients recorded GP practice) to better inform care decisions they may be making for a patient.
