-----------WORK IN PROGRESS---------------

## Vision ##

To link information held within the different GP information systems, allowing it to flow safely and seamlessly between care settings, empowering health providers to make the best care decisions, placing patients firmly at the heart.

## Strategic drivers ##

- [Government Paperless 2020 (Personalised Health and Care Framework)](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/personalised-health-and-care-2020)
  - ‘all patient and care records will be digital, interoperable and real-time by 2020’

- [NHS England General Practice Five Year Forward View](https://www.england.nhs.uk/gp/gpfv/)
  - Greater collaboration and sharing of information through IT system interoperability across the health and care system

## Business drivers ##

Supporting improved access to general practice by:

- providing access to the detailed care record to every practice at the point of care
- appointment management across federated/other estate
- ability to send tasks between practices in a federation
- supporting other care settings for direct care purposes

## Role of NHS Digital ##

### Capabilities ###

A capability is an area of focus for the GP Connect APIs. There are several [initial capabilities defined](overview_priority_capabilities.html).

## Benefits ##

- Clinical
  - real-time access to patients' records to allow clinicians access to the right information, at the right time to help make the right decisions

- Patient/carer
  - increase access opportunities (such as ability to access an appointment anywhere within the federation/hub/other)
  - improved patient experience/satisfaction

- Administrative
  - ability to book or cancel appointments and send tasks or notifications within a local geography across federations/hubs/other
 
- Management
  - ability to understand appointment capacity across federated practices, providing single points of access for patients to book -  meaning more efficient access to services, better resource planning, and improved reporting data

- Technical
  - first 'nationally defined, standards-based' step on the interoperability journey for GP systems

## Case studies ##

## Timescales ## 

### Become an API consumer ###

If you're planning on consuming data using GP Connect APIs then you're a consumer system.

### Become an API provider ###

If you're planning on providing data using GP Connect APIs then you're a provider system.
