## The Open API ecosystem

GP Connect is part of the a wider initiative to expose standards based [Open APIs](https://www.england.nhs.uk/digitaltechnology/info-revolution/interoperability/open-api/){:target="_blank"} to promote innovation and improve care across the NHS.

To make use of the ecosystem and GP Connect APIs we're asking all involved to sign-up to an [Open API licence](designprinciples_open_api_licence_principles.html) which enshrines concepts such as fair-use and expectations around reciprocity of access to data to improve interoperability beyond just primary care.


### Capabilities

A capability is an area of focus for the GP Connect APIs. There are several [initial capabilities defined](overview_priority_capabilities.html).

### Become an API consumer

If you're planning on consuming data using GP Connect APIs then you're a consumer system.

### Become an API provider

If you're planning on providing data using GP Connect APIs then you're a provider system. 

## Get started ##

- Read about the GP Connect [Priority capabilities](overview_priority_capabilities.html).
- Look through the design decisions made so far in relation to each capability packs ([Foundations](foundations_design.html), [Access Record HTML](accessrecord_design.html), [Access Record REST](accessrecord_rest.html), [Appointment Management](appointments_design.html) and [Task Management](tasks_design.html)) and get involved:
	- <span class="label label-success">SELECTED</span> / <span class="label label-info">DECISION</span> A decision has been made for first release.
	- <span class="label label-warning">ASSUMPTION</span> An assumption has been made which is under review/needs validated.

## Provide feedback

To provide feedback on the GP Connect specification please send an email to the [GP Connect Team Inbox](mailto://gpconnect@nhs.net).

Some early feedback on the May 2016 release of the GP Connect draft specification can be found on the [OpenHealthHub forum](https://www.openhealthhub.org/c/fhir-implementation){:target="_blank"} under the category of "FHIR Implementation".

## Community engagement

GP Connect is working closely with a number of interoperability communities:

- [Code4Health interoperability community](http://interoperability.code4health.org/){:target="_blank"}
- [INTEROPen supplier-led healthcare IT interoperability community](http://www.interopen.org/){:target="_blank"}

## Timescales, benefits and more

The content here is designed for a technical audience (i.e. developers, architects and data scientists) for other details (i.e. the vision, timescales, business benefits and case studies) then please see the [NHS Digital GP Connect homepage](https://digital.nhs.uk/article/1275/GP-Connect){:target="_blank"}.
