summary: "Use case for triaged by Clinical Assessment Service clinician after referral to Single Point of Access for mental health"
---

## Brief description
A patient is referred via SPA and it has not been indicated which service is required. Then the referral is passed to the CAS team to triage. The CAS clinician triaging the referral will have full access to the patient’s GP record to ensure that the referral is directed to the correct mental health service.

## Use case justification
Clinical and administration:
-   Access to accurate information at the point of care reducing the opportunity for errors to occur.
-   Reduction in clinical time wasted, away from the patient, collecting and collating information.
-   Reduction in clinical time wasted, away from the patient, manually updating IT systems.
-   Reducing the paper flow through departments/organisations by utilising the system workflow to manage tasks using staff time efficiently.

Patient-focused:
-   Security of patient information is maintained and improved through the reduction of paper-based ‘patient identifiable documents’ in use within departments.
-   Increased patient/clinician time due to reduction in clinician time spent collecting and transcribing information away from the patient.
-   Increased patient safety due to the reduction in manual transcription errors.
-   Better patient experience as they are not being asked for information which should already be available to the clinician.

## Primary actors
-   CAS team
-   Paris system
-   GP Connect
-   GP clinical system

## Secondary actors
-   Patient

## Triggers
-   Patient is referred to mental health services using the Single Point of Access services. A service is not identified.

## Preconditions
-   The patient’s details have been verified and entered on the Paris system.
-   CAS staff have the correct/appropriate system access rights.
-   The patient’s GP has agreed to share patient information via GP Connect.
-   The patient allows this shared information to be viewed/used by GP staff.
-   Electronic interactions between Paris system/GP Connect/GP clinical system have been correctly configured.

## Postconditions
-   **On success**
    - Clinical information is imported and recorded against the local patient record.

-   **Guaranteed**
    - All the relevant available information on the patient’s medical history has been viewable on the PARIS system used by the CAS team to triage the referral to the correct service.
