summary: "Use case for community pharmacy giving a vaccination"
---

## Brief description
A community pharmacist can be asked to give vaccinations either as part of a local service (example: flu vaccination) or as a private service (example: travel vaccinations). There are certain allergies and conditions a pharmacist should check to ensure the vaccination they are giving is safe and appropriate for the patient. These checks can be assisted through access to the patient record. 

## Use case justification
Clinical and administration:
-   Access to accurate information at the point of care reducing the opportunity for errors to occur.
-   Reduction in transcription between systems and paper to IT, leading to a reduction in prescribing errors.
-   Reduction in clinical time wasted, away from the patient, collecting and collating information.
-   Reduction in clinical time wasted, away from the patient, manually updating IT systems.
-   Reducing the paper flow through departments by utilising the system workflow to manage tasks using staff time efficiently.

Patient-focused:
-   Security of patient information is maintained and improved through the reduction of paper-based ‘patient identifiable documents’ in use within departments.
-   Increased patient/clinician time due to reduction in clinician time spent collecting and transcribing information away from the patient.
-   Increased patient safety due to the reduction in manual transcription errors.
-   Better patient experience as they are not being asked for information which should already be available to the pharmacist.

## Primary actors
-   Pharmacist
-   Pharmacy system
-   GP Connect
-   GP clinical system

## Secondary actors
-   Patient

## Triggers
-   Patient attends a community pharmacist for a vaccination.

## Preconditions
-   The patient’s details have been verified and entered on the pharmacy system upon attendance.
-   The pharmacist has the correct/appropriate system access rights.
-   The patient’s GP has agreed to share patient information via GP Connect.
-   The patient allows this shared information to be viewed/used by the pharmacist.
-   Electronic interactions between pharmacy system/GP Connect/GP clinical system have been correctly configured.

## Postconditions
-   **On success**
    - The patient’s medical record is made available to the pharmacist.
-   **Guaranteed**
    - The pharmacist will treat the patient based on the information available.
