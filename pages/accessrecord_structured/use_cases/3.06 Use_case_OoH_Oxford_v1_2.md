summary: "Use case for out of hours GP accesses medications, allergies and problems"
---

## Brief description
A patient calls the OOH GP complaining of pain and asking for painkillers.

The OOH GP wants to check: 
-   What medications the patient is already taking.
-   What they were prescribed for.
-   When they were last issued, and how many.
-   What allergies the patient may have.

The GP has access to an electronic patient record (EPR). The flow of information is from the GP practice clinical system to the OOH EPR.
Data needs to be supplied using SNOMED CT codes. This use case will take place every time an OOH GP appointment takes place. The expected volume of this happening is to be determined.

## Use case justification
Without this information the OOH GP will have to make a judgement on whether it is safe to prescribe the medication the patient is asking for.

## Primary actors
-   OOH GP
-   OOH EPR

## Secondary actors
-   Patient

## Triggers
-   Clinical consultation

## Preconditions
-   The patient is registered on the OOH EPR; NHS Number is available.
-   The OOH EPR can access the GP information.
-   The OOH GP has the relevant permissions to access the information.
-   The patient has consented to share the information.
-   The information is real-time.

## Postconditions

-   **On success**
    - The GP is able to prescribe the most appropriate medication.
-   **Guaranteed**
    - The GP will make a clinical decision based on the information they have.
    - Access is recorded for auditing purposes.
    - Information on which decisions are made is available for critical incident review/medico-legal investigation.
