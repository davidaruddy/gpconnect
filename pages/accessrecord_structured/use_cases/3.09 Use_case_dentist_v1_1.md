summary: "Use case for dentist reviews the GP record when they treat a patient"
---

## Brief description
During an appointment the dentist can review relevant parts of a patient’s record to ensure their actions are clinically appropriate.

## Use case justification
Clinical and administration:
-   Access to accurate information at the point of care reducing the opportunity for errors to occur.
-   Data can be formatted and filtered by the local system, so the clinician is presented the information they need in a suitable format.

Patient -focused:
-   Security of patient information is maintained and improved through the reduction of paper-based ‘patient identifiable documents’ in use within departments.
-   Increased patient/clinician time due to reduction in clinician time spent collecting and transcribing information away from the patient.
-   Better patient experience as they are not being asked for information which should already be available to the clinician.

## Primary actors
-   Dentist
-   Dental system
-   GP Connect
-   GP clinical system

## Secondary actors
-   Patient

## Triggers
-   The patient attending a dental appointment.

## Preconditions
-   The dentist has the correct/appropriate system access rights.
-   The patient’s GP has agreed to share patient information via GP Connect.
-   The patient allows this shared information to be viewed/used by the dentist.
-   Electronic interactions between dental system/GP Connect/GP clinical system have been correctly configured.

## Postconditions
-   **On success**
    - The dentist can view the GP patient’s record and use it to assist in making clinical decision.
