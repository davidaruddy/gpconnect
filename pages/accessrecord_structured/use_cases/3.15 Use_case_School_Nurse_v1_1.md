summary: "Use case for school nurse appointments"
---

## Brief description
During a child’s school attendance, they will have four mandatory appointments with the school nurse. These take place at 4-5 years, 10-11 years, 12-13 years and post 16. Before each of the appointments, the school nurse needs to collect all information about the child to provide the best possible care to the child during development. The school nurse seeing the child will have full access to the child’s record. They may request access to the mother’s and father’s GP record.

## Use case justification
Clinical and administration:
-   Access to accurate information at the point of care, reducing the opportunity for errors to occur.
-   Reduction in clinical time wasted, away from the patient, collecting and collating information.
-   Reduction in clinical time wasted, away from the patient, manually updating IT systems.
-   Reducing the paper flow through departments/organisations by utilising the system workflow to manage tasks using staff time efficiently.

Patient-focused:
-   Security of patient information is maintained and improved through the reduction of paper-based ‘patient identifiable documents’ in use within departments.
-   Increased patient/clinician time due to reduction in clinician time spent collecting and transcribing information away from the patient.
-   Increased patient safety due to the reduction in manual transcription errors.
-   Better patient experience as they are not being asked for information which should already be available to the clinician.

## Primary actors
-   School nurse
-   Community system
-   GP Connect
-   GP clinical system

## Secondary actors
-   Patient

## Triggers
The school nurse will visit the child at:
-   4-5 years
-   10-11 years
-   12-13 years
-   School leavers – post 16

## Preconditions
-   The patient’s details have been verified and entered on the community system.
-   School nurses have the correct/appropriate system access rights.
-   The patient’s GP has agreed to share patient information via GP Connect.
-   The patient allows this shared information to be viewed/used by GP staff.
-   Electronic interactions between community system/GP Connect/GP clinical system have been correctly configured.

## Postconditions
-   **On success**
    - Clinical information is imported and made available to the clinician.
-   **Guaranteed**
    - All the relevant available information on the patient’s medical history has been viewable on the community system used by the school nurse.
