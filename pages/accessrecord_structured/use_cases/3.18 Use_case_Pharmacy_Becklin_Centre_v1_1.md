summary: "Use case for medications reconciliations prior to admission of patient to Becklin Centre"
---

## Brief description
Prior to admission to the Becklin Centre all medications the patient is currently taking need to be recorded on the local medication system. This will be reviewed by a pharmacist and/or clinician to determine what the patient needs to continue taking whilst an inpatient and what needs to be discontinued/paused.

## Use case justification
Clinical and administration:
-   Access to accurate information at the point of care reducing the opportunity for errors to occur.
-   Reduction in transcription between systems and paper to IT, leading to a reduction in errors.
-   Reduction in clinical time wasted, away from the patient, collecting and collating information.
-   Reduction in clinical time wasted, away from the patient, manually updating IT systems.
-   Reducing the paper flow through departments by utilising the system workflow to manage tasks using staff time efficiently.

Patient-focused:
-   Security of patient information is maintained and improved through the reduction of paper-based ‘patient identifiable documents’ in use within departments.
-   Increased patient/clinician time due to reduction in clinician time spent collecting and transcribing information away from the patient.
-   Increased patient safety due to the reduction in manual transcription errors.
-   Better patient experience as they are not being asked for information which should already be available to the clinician.

## Primary actors
-   Pharmacy technician
-   Pharmacist
-   Clinician
-   MedChart system
-   GP Connect
-   GP clinical system

## Secondary actors
-   Patient

## Triggers
-   Patient is to be admitted to the Becklin Centre.

## Preconditions
-   The patient’s details have been verified and entered on the pharmacy’s system.
-   Pharmacy staff have the correct/appropriate system access rights.
-   The patient’s GP has agreed to share patient information via GP Connect.
-   The patient allows this shared information to be viewed/used by hospital staff.
-   Electronic interactions between hospital system(s)/GP Connect/GP clinical system have been correctly configured.

## Postconditions
-   **On success**
    - Clinical information is imported and recorded against the local patient record.
-   **Guaranteed**
    - All the relevant available information on the patient’s medical history has been recorded on the MedChart system.
