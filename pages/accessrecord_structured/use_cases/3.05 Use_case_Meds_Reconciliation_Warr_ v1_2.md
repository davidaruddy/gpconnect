summary: "Use case for medicines reconciliation for acute care admissions"

## Brief description
Upon admission to or attendance at hospital, the attending clinician is responsible for consolidating a list of the patient’s medications. Information on medications listed within the GP system (SCR) is gathered in paper format and then discussed with the patient/patient proxy for validation. Amendments, where required, are annotated on the paper copies. The clinician then manually transcribes all appropriate medications into the hospital Patient Administration System (PAS)/Electronic Patient Record (EPR) system and the patient’s paper drug chart before completing the admission/consultation process.

## Use case justification
Clinical and administration:
-   Access to accurate information at the point of care reducing the opportunity for errors to occur.
-   Reduction in transcription between systems and paper to IT, leading to a reduction in prescribing errors.
-   Reduction in clinical time wasted, away from the patient, collecting and collating information.
-   Reduction in clinical time wasted, away from the patient, manually updating IT systems.
-   Reducing the paper flow through departments by utilising the system workflow to manage tasks using staff time efficiently.

Patient-focused:
-   Security of patient information is maintained and improved through the reduction of paper-based ‘patient identifiable documents’ in use within departments.
-   Increased patient/clinician time due to reduction in clinician time spent collecting and transcribing information away from the patient.
-   Increased patient safety due to the reduction in manual transcription errors.
-   Better patient experience as they are not being asked for information which should already be available to the clinician.

Cost reduction:
-   Reduction in printing supplies.

## Primary actors
-   Clinician
-   PAS/EPR
-   GP Connect
-   GP clinical system

## Secondary actors
-   Patient

## Triggers
-   Patient is admitted to or attends hospital for treatment.

## Preconditions
-   The patient’s details have been verified and entered on the hospitals PAS/EPR upon admission/attendance.
-   Hospital staff have the correct/appropriate system access rights.
-   The patient’s GP has agreed to share patient information via GP Connect.
-   The patient allows this shared information to be viewed/used by hospital staff.
-   Electronic interactions between hospital system(s)/GP Connect/GP clinical system have been correctly configured.
-   An electronic prescribing and medicines administration (ePMA) system is in use and integrates with the PAS/EPR.

## Postconditions
-   **On success**
    - Clinical information is imported and recorded against the local patient record.
-   **Guaranteed**
    - A full history of medication used by the patient on admission/attendance:
      - Medication prescribed by the patient’s GP.
      - Medication prescribed in other care settings.
      - Medication obtained elsewhere – for example ‘over the counter’.
    - Patients receive the correct medications when admitted.
